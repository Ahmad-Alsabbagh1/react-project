# AHMAD'S TRIVIA
## Introduction
A trivia game made using React.js framework as a react-project for HackYourFuture.<br/>
With the help of the [Trivia](https://the-trivia-api.com/) API the player gets 10 question with the selected difficulty(default = easy) or some selected categories(optional).

After the **START** button wished the player good luck (hovering over the button) the player will be prompted with a question with the selected categorie(s) 
or all categories, and 4 choices for the answer. Choosing an answer will trigger the following question but you can always go back with the **Previous question** button and choose a different answer if you like.

After answering all the questions you will be greeted with the results page and it will tell you how many questions were answered correctly and a message depending of how you preformed!

The game is responsive and can be used on: phones, tablets, laptops, etc... .
